## **Fruits Basket** 
**Fruits Basket** is a heartwarming Japanese anime and manga series created by *Natsuki Takaya*. It tells the story of **Tohru Honda**, a kind-hearted girl who gets involved with the mysterious **Sohma family**, who are cursed to transform into animals of the Chinese zodiac when hugged by someone of the opposite sex.

# i like this because:
Fruits Basket is more than just a love story it’s about healing, acceptance, and finding family in unexpected places. The characters grow beautifully, and every episode teaches something about empathy and emotional strength. It’s comforting, sad, and hopeful all at once.
